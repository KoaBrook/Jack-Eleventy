  <h1>What I Write</h1>
  <p>Surprise! This whole website is actually a ploy to get you interested in my writing! And it worked, I tell you! It worked! Mwa ha ha ha - ah-hem...</p>
<p>Sorry about that... but yes, it's true. I'm a writer and I want you to know it! To date I've written five novels all in different states of completion which I hope I can share with you at some point. Obviously I'm aiming for publication and having a platform is a huge part of that nowadays, which is why I've built this website. Of course, I knew I couldn't just build a website and I want to give something back to you, which is why I've included, and will continue to add, articles on my research and anything else I can think of in future.</p>
<p>It would be a huge help if you would subscribe to my newsletter which will keep you updated about any cool stuff I add to the site as well as my work.</p>

            <p>In a world where humans are gone, animals inexplicably develop the capacity to speak , build and live together in relative harmony. One problem; whatever caused the humans to disappear also took all the large animals. One rat will go on a quest to bring them back. On the way he will meet great companions, make fearsome enemies and confront the hard truth about what really happened to the humans.</p>

            <p>One day, time is lost. How such a thing can even happen is unclear, but happen it does. Now travelling to different times is as simple as walking from one room to another and two friends plan to do just that. Hopping from one time to another they search for an answer to the question of what happened the day time was lost?</p>
