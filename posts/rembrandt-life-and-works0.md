Lets talk about one of the most famous painters of all time.

Uh oh… Are you talking about Old van Rijn? He’s the closest thing the gallery has to a president or leader. He’s kind of a pain in my--**

Whoa there, Sketch! Remember not to get the artists themselves confused with the characters in their art. Even self portraits have their own personalities.

So my Van Rijn isn’t necessarily representative of the real one, right?

Not necessarily. Although learning more about the original artist might help you better understand the art.

Okay. I’m listening!

Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (1606 – 1669) was a Dutch painter and etcher. He’s often considered one of the best, most important painters in European history.

Rembrandt’s family was of average wealth, able to support him through school. But Rembrandt quickly got tired of education and decided to ditch school when he was 14.

Why would he do that?

Well, he wanted to pursue his true passion: painting.

In 1624, when he was 18, Rembrandt went to Amsterdam to study with Pieter Lastman (1583 – 1633), another Dutch painter considered to be mostly awesome, famous for his historical paintings.

Lastman also had another pupil called Jan Lievens who Rembrandt worked and became friends with. When Rembrandt moved back to his home town, he and Jan opened a workshop together and started work as independent artists. This was at the same time that the Protestant Reformation was taking place.

The what reformation?

The Protestant Reformation was a movement which looked to reform beliefs and practises in the Roman Catholic Church. Well... Actually this wasn’t the only goal of the reform as politicians used it as a way to gain more authority too.

Anyway, at this time the church stopped commissioning artists, so Rembrandt had to take private commissions. Most of his work at the time was on historical paintings. Unlike many artists at the time, Rembrandt didn’t move to Italy to study art, instead he moved back to Amsterdam. Here he moved in with a guy called Hendrick van Uylenburgh who became a good friend. It was also pretty handy that Uylenburgh turned out to be an art dealer, and he really helped launch Rembrandt’s career.

It’s always nice to have good friends willing to help you out, isn’t it?

Of course!

It was also here that Rembrandt met the beautiful Saskia

Saskia is a nice name.

It is, and turns out she was a nice girl too! Saskia was the cousin of Rembrandt’s landlord. They hit it off and were happily married in 1634.

Great! Everything’s looking good for Old van Rijn.

Yeah, well… Brace yourself. This is where it all starts getting a bit depressing.

Why does this always happen when you’re telling me the life stories of famous artists?

Two years after he and Saskia were married they had a baby, but it died after only a few weeks. Not letting it get them down they continued to try for children but sadly two more died in the same way.

Despite these years of emotional hardship Rembrandt’s art went form strength to strength. All the biggest and most important families and organisations commissioned him and he became very famous and very rich. He and Saskia moved into a big house next to van Uylenburgh.

Then, finally in 1641 they had another baby boy who managed to fight his way into the world – and for his efforts he was appropriately named Titus.

Okay, so 1641 and everything seems okay! He’s rich, famous, has a big house and baby Titan is alive and well!

Unfortunately things were not as calm as they seemed...

Nooo… Why do you always do this?

I’m afraid that shortly after Titus was born Saskia got ill and died in 1642. Of course Rembrandt was heartbroken but he moved on. Whilst Saskia had been ill the family had hired a nurse for Titan called Geertje Dircx who Rembrandt later started a relationship with. But it didn’t last and Dircx took Rembrandt to court for ‘breach of promise’ which means that Rembrandt had allegedly seduced her by promising he would marry her later, which he obviously didn’t do.

She won the case and was awarded a steady income from Rembrandt. In hindsight though it wasn’t such a victory because later on, after learning she had stolen and pawned a piece of jewellery he had given to Saskia, Rembrandt had her committed to a correctional facility called ‘bridewell’ for twelve years.

Woah! Do not cross this man... Talk about getting your own back.

After a while Rembrandt took a new servant called Hendrickje Stoffels who he fell in love with. This caused a number of complications though because in Saskia’s will it said that if Rembrandt took on another wife he wouldn’t have access to her fortune. So, he couldn’t actually afford to marry Hendrickje. Even so, they remained together for many years, brought up Titan together and even had a daughter called Cornelia.

Hang on, I thought Rembrandt was rich?

He was, but he had a bad habit of spending all his money on expensive artworks and materials. Bare in mind he was also still paying an annual settlement to Dircx at this point.

Things got worse for him financially in 1650 when there was an economic depression in Amsterdam. Rembrandt grew poorer and poorer and soon enough he was in deep trouble. Six years later he managed to gain a ‘respectable form of bankruptcy’ which meant he wouldn’t have to be imprisoned but he lost all his materials and collections and had to move to a smaller, poorer area.

Things just get worse from here on, I’m afraid. Sadly, Hendrickje died in 1663 from a long term illness, and just to rub salt in the wound Rembrandt had to sell Sasika’s tomb to make ends meet.

In 1668 Titus left to marry a childhood friend but died just one year later at the age of 26. Fortunately he had already conceived a daughter who was born six months after his death and who was called called Titia in honour of her father.

A year later Rembrandt himself died and was buried with his son and his second love, Stoffels.

That’s such a tragic story…

When we lay it out like this, it is. But there’s a lot f positive stuff here too.

When it comes to technical artistic skill it’s fair to describe Rembrandt as a pure genius. He learnt all there was to know about oil painting from his teachers  and then quickly began experimenting in new ways of using it. He surpassed both his teachers very quickly and never stopped coming up with new innovations. That’s why he’s (rightfully) celebrated for his art still to this day.

So what were some of the things he did that were so special?

The area Rembrandt excelled in was his use of lighting effects. By experimenting with multiple layers of paint and varying levels of opacity he was able to discover new ways of creating realistic and deep works.

Interestingly, scientific analysis of his work highlight some of the technical things Rembrandt did to guide the eye of the spectator and to give his paintings more detail and ‘life’. They say that it's been proven that his art is composed in such a specific way that the eye is drawn to certain points and then encouraged to linger there, this way viewing his work has a calming effect on people. He was able to achieve this with complex paint mixtures using eggs, ground glass, chalk and other things. He also used experimental techniques such as scratching details with sharp edges and much more.

Well, I’ve seen a lot of his work now and it always impressed me… I’ve also met a lot of his self-portraits. They always seem so sad to me.

It’s true he did paint a lot of self-portraits. When he died he left over 90 of them from different periods in his life.

Well, thanks for the story. Although I feel a little sad now. Hey, I’d like to learn more about his self-portraits and some of his other paintings I’ve met. Could you tell me something?

Yeah, of course! But I think we’ve covered enough for today, so why don’t you come back tomorrow and I’ll talk more about his specific works?

Sounds good! Thanks. And you guys don’t forget to come back again too. Hopefully it won’t be quite so sad tomorrow!
